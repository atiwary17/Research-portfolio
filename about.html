    <p>I'm a Ph.D. student with a passion for unraveling Earth's ancient climate mysteries. My journey involves deciphering the secrets of the past through paleoclimatology and geochemistry. By exploring lake sediment deposits, I piece together Earth's climate history with a special focus on abrupt extreme events during the Holocene. I'm on a mission to bridge the past with our climate challenges today, contributing to improved climate projections. Join me in this exciting journey of discovery!</p>
