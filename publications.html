        <h3>Assessing the impacts of Little Ice Age on the Western Himalayas</h3>
        <p>Anubhav Singh, Aakanksha Kumari, Bhavuk Sharma, Rajalakshmi S, Dr. Yama Dixit, accepted in Holocene Sage Journals (Submission ID: HOL-23-0135), 2023</p>
        <p>This study investigated the hydroclimatic variability of the Western Himalayan region. Focusing on moisture source dynamics, using HYSPLIT, the region is divided into three subdivisions based on the relative contributions of the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea, and Westerlies to moisture sources. The Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) influence increases southwards, except in the southwest where westerlies play a more significant role. Aback-trajectory analysis reveals a lack of a clear linear trend due to complex topography. Proxy records comparison indicates coherent high moisture conditions during the Little Ice Age (LIA), characterized by increased winter precipitation and decreased summer precipitation, suggesting a weaker ISM. An out-of-phase relationship between ISM and westerlies is observed. Spectral and wavelet analysis identifies common period bands related to climate drivers such as solar cycles, North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The study highlights the clear signature of the LIA in the region, attributed to external forcings like decreased solar activity and increased volcanic activity. Despite limited high-resolution records, the research provides a comprehensive regional perspective on hydroclimatic variability in the Western Himalayas. The spatially heterogeneous response of the region to LIA cooling underscores the need for climate reconstructions to understand climatic patterns and associated mechanisms. The Western Himalayas exhibit non-uniform responses to global changes, emphasizing the importance of careful considerations in assessing regional impacts of current and future climate changes.</p>

        <h3>Hydroclimatic impacts of ‘8.2-ka event’ in western Indo-Pacific Warm Pool</h3>
        <p>Yama Dixit, Stephen Chua, Aakanksha Kumari, Yu Ting Yan, Adam D. Switzer, under review in Nature Communications Earth and Environment (Submission ID: COMMSENV-22-0355A), 2023</p>
        <p>In this study, we have investigated the hydroclimate response of the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP) region during the Holocene's notable climate event, the '8.2 ka event.' Utilizing a high-resolution stable carbon isotope record from foraminifera species Asterorotalia pulchella and sediment characteristics in a marine sediment core from the Kallang River Basin, Singapore, the study reveals a ~180-year period of weakened rainfall in the western tropical Indo-Pacific region from ~8.25 ka to 7.96 ka BP. The data, supported by sedimentological proxies, suggests a lag of approximately 100 years between the onset of reduced convective activity in the western IPWP region and the cooling in the North Atlantic, as well as synchronous droughts in the Asian and Indian monsoon regions. This lag implies a possible north-south signal propagation via oceanic routes on centennial scales. The termination of the '8.2 ka event' is proposed to have occurred near synchronously between high and low tropical regions at ~7.96 ka BP, potentially linked through both atmospheric and oceanic processes.</p>
