        <h3> Indian summer monsoon variability during the past ten thousand years </h3>
        <p> University of Queensland \& IIT Delhi Academy of Research (UQIDAR), Aug 2022 - Present</p>
        <p class="research-summary">Working on reconstructing high-resolution past monsoon changes in the plains of northwest India with more focus on studying lakes located at the margin of the Thar Desert in northwest India, including Kotla Dahar Lake, Riwasa Lake, and Karanpura Lake to map out the evolution of Thar Desert.</p>

        <p class="full-description">The Thar Desert margins which were densely populated about 5000 years ago are now one of the most vulnerable regions to the projected future climate change. Existing observational climate data do not encompass the full range of long-term climate patterns. This highlights a need for comprehensive research to understand the past long-term climate variability in this region. The objectives of my study are to reconstruct high-resolution past monsoon changes, with a particular focus on abrupt events like 8.2 and 4.2 kyr BP, providing insights into the dynamics and patterns of ISM over time, to contribute to archaeological investigations on the Bronze Age Indus civilization by providing well-dated climate records, to integrate paleoclimate records with modern observations and validate climate models, enabling more accurate future projections of the ISM, to use multi-proxy records in conjunction with the PMIP output to accurately map the response of Thar desert margin to changing rainfall.<a href="#" class="read-less-link">Read Less</a></p>

        <h3>Assessing the hydroclimate changes in Western Himalayas during the Little Ice Age</h3>
        <p>University of Queensland \& IIT Delhi Academy of Research (UQIDAR), Jan 2023 - Aug 2023</p>
        <p class="research-summary">Investigated the hydroclimate conditions in the Western Himalayas by synthesizing and assessing the existing paleoclimate records (Speleothems and tree rings) quantitatively.</p>
        <a href="#" class="read-more-link">Read More</a>
        <p class="This study investigated the hydroclimatic variability of the Western Himalayan region. Focusing on moisture source dynamics, using HYSPLIT, the region is divided into three subdivisions based on the relative contributions of the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea, and Westerlies to moisture sources. The Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) influence increases southwards, except in the southwest where westerlies play a more significant role. Aback-trajectory analysis reveals a lack of a clear linear trend due to complex topography. Proxy records comparison indicates coherent high moisture conditions during the Little Ice Age (LIA), characterized by increased winter precipitation and decreased summer precipitation, suggesting a weaker ISM. An out-of-phase relationship between ISM and westerlies is observed. Spectral and wavelet analysis identifies common period bands related to climate drivers such as solar cycles, North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The study highlights the clear signature of the LIA in the region, attributed to external forcings like decreased solar activity and increased volcanic activity. Despite limited high-resolution records, the research provides a comprehensive regional perspective on hydroclimatic variability in the Western Himalayas. The spatially heterogeneous response of the region to LIA cooling underscores the need for climate reconstructions to understand climatic patterns and associated mechanisms. The Western Himalayas exhibit non-uniform responses to global changes, emphasizing the importance of careful considerations in assessing the regional impacts of current and future climate changes. <a href="#" class="read-less-link">Read Less</a></p>
