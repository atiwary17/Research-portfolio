        <h3> Indian summer monsoon variability during the past ten thousand years </h3>
        <p> University of Queensland \& IIT Delhi Academy of Research (UQIDAR), Aug 2022 - Present</p>
        <p class="research-summary">Working on reconstructing high-resolution past monsoon changes in the plains of northwest India with more focus on studying lakes located at the margin of the Thar Desert in northwest India, including Kotla Dahar Lake, Riwasa Lake, and Karanpura Lake to map out the evolution of Thar Desert.</p>

        <p class="full-description">The Thar Desert margins which were densely populated about 5000 years ago are now one of the most vulnerable regions to the projected future climate change. Existing observational climate data do not encompass the full range of long-term climate patterns. This highlights a need for comprehensive research to understand the past long-term climate variability in this region. The objectives of my study are to reconstruct high-resolution past monsoon changes, with a particular focus on abrupt events like 8.2 and 4.2 kyr BP, providing insights into the dynamics and patterns of ISM over time, to contribute to archaeological investigations on the Bronze Age Indus civilization by providing well-dated climate records, to integrate paleoclimate records with modern observations and validate climate models, enabling more accurate future projections of the ISM, to use multi-proxy records in conjunction with the PMIP output to accurately map the response of Thar desert margin to changing rainfall.<a href="#" class="read-less-link">Read Less</a></p>
